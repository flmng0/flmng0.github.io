However, I ended up preferring the cleaner look of a regular CSS grid.</p>\n<p>The algorithm for laying out the items in the grid is relatively simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> First, select the first column, and place one of the items in it.</li>\n<li> Next, select the next column.</li>\n<li> Until the current column is as tall (or taller) than the previous column, place items on the current column.</li>\n<li> Repeat steps 2-3 until all items have been placed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Even though it is relatively simple, it achieves quite nice results, at least, in my opinion. You can see the layout patterns above, with randomly sized grid items.</p>\n"}
